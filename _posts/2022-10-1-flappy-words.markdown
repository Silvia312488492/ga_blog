This is my final website, and it's called Flappy Words, a sort of game-like interactive website for jumping through obstacles. I thought and used many ideas to make this website.


<h4>1.Make the background picture and obstacle column of the website.</h4>
In order to follow the effective complexity interaction, I added barrier bars to ensure the implementation of the game, as well as decorative background images to make the site more visually pleasing.

<h4>2.Use squares and text as the characters of the game</h4>
In making the characters for the game, I used geometry and text to interact. I made five squares and added text to each of them.The composition was' Happy'.It stands for joy as a game.

<h4>3.Mouse firework interaction</h4>
This is the most bright interactive production, when the mouse click any place on the screen of the site, it will appear colorful circular fireworks, and Happy text matching, because the colorful also has a certain degree of visual appreciation.

<h4>4.Mouse game Interaction</h4>
In the game, click with the mouse game screen, 5 square will follow the mouse move up and down like a small train, need through the obstacles and avoid to touch to ensure to continue the game, in the game interesting point is that five squares represent five lives and opportunities, if the leader square met with obstacles, it will disappear automatically, which naturally lose a life, Until all the squares disappear, the game is over.
